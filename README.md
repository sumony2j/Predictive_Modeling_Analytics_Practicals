# Python Implementations for Predictive Modeling and Analytics

Welcome to the Python Implementations for Predictive Modeling and Analytics repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various statistical tests and techniques commonly used in predictive modeling and analytics.

## Overview

Predictive modeling and analytics involve using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make predictions. This repository provides Python implementations for a variety of techniques, including:

- **F-test**: A statistical test used to compare the variances of two populations.
- **T-test**: A statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: A statistical technique used to compare means across multiple groups.
- **Linear Square Estimation**: A method used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model.
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: A technique used to analyze the correlation between observations in time series data.
- **Least Squares Method**: A method used to find the best-fitting line through a set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations.

Each implementation is accompanied by detailed explanations, code examples, and usage instructions to help you understand and apply these techniques in your own projects.

## Contents

The repository includes Python scripts and excel sheets demonstrating the implementation of each technique. You'll find code examples illustrating how to perform F-tests, t-tests, ANOVA, linear square estimation, autocorrelation analysis, and least squares method using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and pandas etc.

## Usage

To get started, for the technique you're interested in, open the corresponding Python script . Each file contains code examples along with comments explaining the implementation details and usage instructions. You can run the code in your local Python environment or in a Jupyter notebook to experiment with the techniques and understand how they work.
